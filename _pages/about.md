I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://www.ualberta.ca/economics/index.html) at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html), Canada, supervised by [Prof. Marco Brianti](https://sites.google.com/site/marcobriantieconomics/). My research interests lie in applied macroeconomics and dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. My current investigations delve into the investment and dividend distribution behaviors of firms, with a particular focus on SVAR estimation and DSGE modeling.

I'm also a CFA candidate and I received my MS in Economics from [Xiamen University](https://www.xmu.edu.cn) and BS in Finance from [Wuhan University](http://www.whu.edu.cn). I am proficient in several programming languages in Python, C++, Matlab, and Latex. I use my programming skills to design a package for marcoeconomist of SVAR estimation. I'm also interested in the machines learning and deep learning models. You can find the sample of my codes [here](https://github.com/fangli-DX3906).

I will be on the job market for the 2023/2024 academic year.
