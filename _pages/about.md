Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://www.ualberta.ca/economics/index.html) at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html), Canada, supervised by [Prof. Marco Brianti](https://sites.google.com/site/marcobriantieconomics/). I will be on the job market for the 2023/2024 academic year and am actively seeking positions within the financial industry, data science field, private sector, or at central banks.

My research interests lie in applied macroeconomics and dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. My current investigations focuses the investment and dividend distribution behaviors of firms, SVAR estimation and DSGE modeling. 

I'm also a CFA candidate (passed the level III exam). Besides, I am proficient in several programming languages, including Python, C++, Matlab, and LaTeX. I utilize my programming skills to design a package for macroeconomists focusing on SVAR estimation. Additionally, I have an interest in machine learning and deep learning models. You can find a sample of my codes [here](https://github.com/fangli-DX3906).
