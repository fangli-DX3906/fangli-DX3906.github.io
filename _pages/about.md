I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://www.ualberta.ca/economics/index.html) at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html), Canada, supervised by [Prof. Marco Brianti](https://sites.google.com/site/marcobriantieconomics/). My research interests lie in applied macroeconomics and dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. My current investigations delve into the investment and dividend distribution behaviors of firms, with a particular focus on SVAR estimation and DSGE modeling.

I am also a CFA candidate and have received my MS in Economics from [Xiamen University](https://www.xmu.edu.cn) and BS in Finance from [Wuhan University](http://www.whu.edu.cn). I am proficient in several programming languages, including Python, C++, Matlab, and LaTeX. I utilize my programming skills to design a package for macroeconomists focusing on SVAR estimation. Additionally, I have an interest in machine learning and deep learning models. You can find a sample of my codes [here](https://github.com/fangli-DX3906).

I will be on the job market for the 2023/2024 academic year.
