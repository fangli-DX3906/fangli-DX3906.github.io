I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://www.ualberta.ca/economics/index.html) at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html), Canada. My research interest are in applied macroeconimcs and dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. My current research focuses firm's investment and dividend distribution behavior, SVAR estimation, and DSGE modeling.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Marco Brianti](https://sites.google.com/site/marcobriantieconomics/) from the Department of Economics at the University of Alberta. I received my MS in Economics from [Xiamen University](https://www.xmu.edu.cn) and BS in Finance from [Wuhan University](http://www.whu.edu.cn).

I will be on the job market for the 2023/2024 academic year.
