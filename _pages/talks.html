#### Corporate Cash, Investment, and Uncertainty
job market paper

Using firm-level data from Compustat and FISD, I found that, conditional on the aggregate uncertainty level, corporate investment decreases in response to the cash shock, and dividend distribution increases. I built a simple DSGE model with a flight-to-safety feature to match the empirical results. This occurs because the shareholder shifts her asset holding from a risky asset to a riskless asset, thereby squeezing the firm's resources. I also implemented a welfare analysis, and it shows that adding a flight-to-safety feature creates a welfare cost and is thus suboptimal.
